									<!-- Introduction Section -->
									<section>
										<h3 class="major">My Story</h3>
										<p>Hi, I’m Dryver Zain Finch, a geographer and remote sensing specialist with a passion for leveraging geospatial technologies to address environmental challenges. My journey began at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, where I earned my Bachelor of Science in Geographic Information Science and Technology, graduating Magna Cum Laude. During my undergraduate studies, I discovered my love for remote sensing and its potential to transform how we monitor and manage natural resources.</p>
										<p>Currently, I’m pursuing a Master of Science in Geography at the University of Tennessee, specializing in remote sensing applications for resource management. My research focuses on integrating satellite- and UAV-based multispectral and hyperspectral imagery with machine learning techniques to support sustainable land use, conservation, and ecological restoration. I’m particularly interested in how these tools can be used to study hydrological systems and improve environmental decision-making.</p>

									<!-- Professional Experience Section -->
									<section>
										<h3 class="major">Professional Journey</h3>
										<p>My professional experience has allowed me to apply my skills in diverse settings, from academic research to industry collaborations. As a <strong>GIS Lab Assistant</strong> at the University of Tennessee, I’ve had the opportunity to work on exciting projects, such as gathering UAV-based LiDAR and multispectral imagery of fluvial riparian systems before and after a planned dam removal at Cherokee National Forest. This work has deepened my understanding of how geospatial technologies can support ecological restoration and environmental monitoring.</p>
										<p>I’ve also worked as a <strong>Graduate Teaching Assistant</strong>, where I created lesson plans for GEOG 413: Remote Sensing of the Environment. Teaching programming beginners to utilize the Google Earth Engine Data Catalog in a Python environment has been incredibly rewarding, as it allows me to share my passion for remote sensing with the next generation of geographers.</p>
										<p>In addition to my academic roles, I’ve gained valuable experience as a <strong>Research Intern</strong> at Oak Ridge National Laboratory through the SULI and ECO programs. There, I supported sensor capability assessments and AI detection algorithm development for commercial geospatial applications. This experience allowed me to explore the intersection of remote sensing and artificial intelligence, further expanding my skill set.</p>
										<p>Earlier in my career, I worked as an <strong>Environmental Compliance Intern</strong> at the Knoxville Utilities Board, where I developed records-management systems for OSHA, EPA, and TDEC annual reports. I also created site maps for stormwater management reports and designed mapping methods for hearing-protection zones using ArcGIS heatmap analysis and GPS decibel readings. These experiences taught me the importance of clear communication and effective data visualization in environmental compliance and decision-making.</p>

									<!-- Current Work Section -->
									<section>
										<h3 class="major">What I’m Working On Now</h3>
										<p>Currently, I’m focused on developing <strong>MAESon</strong>, a software tool for raster and point cloud data analysis. This project aims to streamline geospatial workflows and make advanced analytical tools more accessible to researchers and practitioners. MAESon is a reflection of my commitment to creating practical solutions that address real-world challenges in environmental monitoring and resource management.</p>
										<p>In addition to MAESon, I’m also working on documentation and resources for my role as a GIS Lab Assistant. These materials are designed to help students and researchers navigate the complexities of GIS and remote sensing tools, empowering them to tackle their own projects with confidence. You can explore these and other projects on my <a href="https://github.com/dzfinch">GitHub profile</a>.</p>
